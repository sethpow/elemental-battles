## Reporting An Issue

If you're about to raise an issue because you think you've found a problem with documentation, please read this first.

The GitHub issue tracker is the preferred channel for [Reporting A Game Issue](#reporting-a-game-issue), [New Feature Requests](#new-feature-request), and [Submitting Pull Requests](#submitting-pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **search for existing issues**. Help us keep duplicate issues to a minimum by checking to see if someone has already reported your problem or requested your idea.

* Please **be civil**. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others. See also our [Contributor Code of Conduct](#conduct).

### Reporting a Game Issue

A game issue is a _demonstrable problem_ that is present in the card-game repository. Good reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for documentation issue reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; look for [closed issues in the
   current milestone](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-card-game-repo/issues?q=is:issue+is:closed) or try to find it using the latest branch for the relevant lesson.

A good issue report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Be sure to include the details of your environment and relevant tests that demonstrate the problem.

[Report an issue](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-card-game-repo/issues/new?title=%5Bdocs%5D%20Suggestion%20/%20Change%20Request)

### New Feature Request

New feature requests are welcome. Before you submit one be sure to have:

1. **Use the GitHub search** and check the new document hasn't already been requested.
2. Take a moment to think about whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
3. Remember, it's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's leaders of the merits of this documentation request.

### Change Requests

If you have an idea for improvement - please be sure to:

1. **Use the GitHub search** and check someone else didn't get there first
2. Take a moment to think about the best way to make a case for, and explain what you're thinking. Are you sure this shouldn't really be
   [New Feature Request](#new-feature-request)?  Is it really one idea or is it many? What's the context? Why is what you are suggesting better than what's already there?

## Working on Elemental Battles

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! If you are looking for a good place to start, check out the [good first issue](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-card-game-repo/labels/good%20first%20issue) label in GitHub issues.

Also, please follow these guidelines when submitting your proposed documentation changes:

### Branches

To get it out of the way:

- **Lesson Branches** contain the contents of each lesson. Changes are usually made in lesson-0 or lesson-1 and then merged into later lesson branches to ensure consistency.
- **[master](https://github.com/EOSIO/welcome/tree/master)** contains the main README file only.Do **NOT** use this branch to add any code.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are awesome. If you're looking to raise a PR for something which doesn't have an open issue, please think carefully about [raising an issue](#reporting-an-issue) which your PR can close. This makes it more likely that there will be enough information available for your PR to be properly tested and merged.
